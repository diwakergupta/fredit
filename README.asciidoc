Fredit: A Fresh Editor
======================

Rationale
---------

I am starting Fredit because I like Vim, but the Vim code is not very friendly.
Emacs has a more active community, but Emacs is just too bloated. More
importantly, neither Vim or Emacs have what I believe the right architecture for
a text editor. I also find it shocking that the core code and architecture of
these two editors have not changed in almost two decades now. I don't know about
you, but I personally am ready for a change -- a new editor with a better
design and potential to fully exploit contemporary hardware and software.

Yzis was going in the right direction, but that project is dead now.

Plan
----

- start with the Yzis code base. Retain the core ideas and architecture.
- Use GNU source highlight for syntax highlighting.
- Use Lua for scripting and configuration.
- Use Waf as the build system.
- Use Google style guide for C++.
- License everything under GPL2 for now.
- Use Google gflags for command line parsing.
- Use Google glog for logging.

Requirements
------------

- google gflags
- google glog
- qt4
- ncurses
- GNU source highlight

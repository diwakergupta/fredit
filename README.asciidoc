Fredit: A Fresh Editor
======================

Rationale
---------

I am starting Fredit because I like Vim, but the Vim code is not very friendly.
Emacs has a more active community, but Emacs is just too bloated.

Yzis was going in the right direction, but the project is dead now.

Plan
----

- start with the Yzis code base. Retain the core ideas and architecture.
- Use GNU source highlight for syntax highlighting.
- Use Lua for scripting and configuration.
- Use Waf as the build system.
- Use Google style guide for C++.
- License everything under GPL2 for now.
